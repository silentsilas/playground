Lost my reason to wake in the morning  
Ever since you left me without warning.  
We've always seemed to have gotten along  
Now I'm wondering if I did you wrong.

Lost my reason to give you thanks and praise.  
Each day that passes passes in a daze.  
The life I live is a life of decay.  
My happiness happens to never stay.

I would have treated you so much better,  
Or perhaps branded a scarlet letter  
Across my chest and openly confess  
That I'm impressed by a snack I love best.

Oh chocolate muffin, why'd you have to leave?  
I've learned not to wear my heart on my sleeve.  
Instead my love will always be suppressed  
As I keep it locked in a chocolate chest.
