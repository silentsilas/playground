In a moment
Of relapse,
A desire
For love
Arose.

I gave my heartstrings
To a girl
To knit a warmer
Set of clothes.

I was hoping
For a sweater,
But instead,
Received her mask.

She thanked me kindly
For the coat
And I knew
I shouldn't ask.

Was it
Seasonal depression
That left me seeking
Out a sun?

A candle
Can't replace it,
But any fire
Is better than none.
