The only
Drink that quenches
Dulls the senses
Until
All discretion
Is lost.

What
Enabled this dependence?
My college attendance?
Is that their
Accreditation's cost?

Is it
The fault of my genes?
A man who
Couldn't stay clean
Then passed down
The ~~bottles~~ battles he lost?

Or was it
My lack of socializing
That kept me subsidizing
Charisma
With each drink
I came across?
