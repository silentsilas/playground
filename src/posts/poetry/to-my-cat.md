All things must pass,
But your exit was unfair.
I still keep my water glass
Out of reach of your stare.

All things must pass,
But I’m stuck in this nightmare.
I knew our time wouldn’t last,
Yet your presence is everywhere.

Daylight will find its way,
But your passing clouds my vision.
What good is my well-being
If you’re not there for it envisioned?

I’d never complain about my black clothes
Covered in your hair
If it means when I lint roll
It signifies that you’re still there.

But no,
This breaks all the rules.
I still keep my door ajar.
I know you hate it when it’s closed,
But I don’t know where you are.
