I sort of spaced out
Into an ethereal dream

While she fell back
Into her usual routine

Of noticing
Amidst the material

That

Which my eyes have never seen.

She ponders for a bit in confusion
The possible reasons for my doubt,
But it's the subject of possibility
The inexplicable mind can't figure out

As I soar above the tops of buildings
And dive into the Atlantic ocean
With uncanny buoyancy I believed
As just another preconceived notion

Until I cast that fact
Into the back
Of the recycle bin

After I break
The REM cycle
And consciousness
clocks back in.

And still you ask
Why I've yet
To fall in love again?
