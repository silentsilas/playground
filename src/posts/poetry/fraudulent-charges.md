His fear of the unforeseen arose,
Which he thought t'was vanquished long ago.
Alas,
He found his faith in illusion:
A financial foundation
To cope with confusion.

Words and the wind
Could now freely hold sway
With the worst of his worries
The most willing to stay:

"Worthless are you,
Workaholic Anonymous!
Heartless are you
To become autonomous!"

They raged until
He raised himself
Back up from the ground.

"I hear you, wind.
I hear you, words."
Until he heard
Only sound.
