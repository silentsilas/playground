Knowledge is a splatter of color
Across the canvas of your brain
To gradually form a masterpiece
With every splatter you gain.

But these splats are not simply skills and facts,
Else you're left with but reds and blues.
For hidden within every facet of life,
Will you find colors of every shade and hue.

But an expansive canvas is required
If you're to create a work of art.
For only to those with a humble mind
Will life have knowledge to impart.

Look at matters from a new perspective,
See the colors others have to show.
Close up not your mind to wisdom;
It's hard to learn if you think you know.
