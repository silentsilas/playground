title: Klepto Couches

---
My home houses countless couches.  
Klepto-couches with pickpocket pouches  
That swiftly swipe your cellular phone  
Between the cushions of their comfy unknown.

Then your change jingles and jangles  
Until they're untangled  
From your Wrangler jeans pocket  
As you wonder where your socks went.

But your socks and shoes  
Were swept under your feet  
Right under your nose.

So discreet are these deceitful seats  
As they watch you search  
For the keys they stole.

At last your quest  
Leads you straight to the crook.  
"I should have guessed  
The klepto-couches had took!"

But still your lesson  
Has yet to be learned.  
These klepto-couches  
Deserve to be burned.
