With each passing moment,
A court case is held
For our mind to determine
Which actions to compel.

86 billion neurons
Take up the jury seats
And fire off responses
'Til a majority agrees.

"Your Honor, you don't exist,
But as an emergent behavior;
Yet still we reached a verdict
That should work in our favor."

The neurons are dismissed
Then return to jury duty
For another microcosm case
In their show of Judge Judy.
