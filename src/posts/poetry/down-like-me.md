I wish that you were down like me.

To both clown around
And fall apart at the seams.

To take life by the horns
As you shout "C'est la vie!"

To melt in its fire
Then break the mold as you leave.

To cut through the crap
To see if the world bleeds

And once we find it doesn't,
Figure out how it still stings.
