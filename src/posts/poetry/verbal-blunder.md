No!
That was simply a slip of the tongue.
Is it too late for me to play along?

I fear I'm no longer as mysterious,
As wise, and as fearless
As I've implied myself to be.

I've revealed my true colors.
I'll soon be discovered;
This shall show my sheer stupidity!

'Tis time to hang up my hat and accept this mistake
Since it seems I don't quite have what it takes
To fool these fools how non-foolish I am.
If only things had gone according to plan,

For I have heard it said:
He who knows, does not speak.
He who speaks, does not know.
I had taken this to heart
And so my heart I would never show.
