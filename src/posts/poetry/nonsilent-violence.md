When you speak,
Our ears must listen,
Whether or not
Our mind attends.

Your vocal cords
Disturb the air
Which strike more drums
Than you might intend.

So I walked away
In search of Quiet,
But my mind was troubled
By the sounds it made.

I echoed them
Into the air
And saw each branch
Throwing their shade.
