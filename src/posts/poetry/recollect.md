The television blared at a volume
That I could hardly handle,
But you were sound asleep
As if such sounds could hold no candle
To whatever sublime sounds
Your subconscious wished to hear;
So I watched the rest, and watched you rest,
As I sipped another beer.

There goes another little memory
That neither of us can share.
If I add mine up,
And add yours up,
Will it be enough to care?

My smartphone delivered multimedia
Directly into my eyes and ears
Until the audiovisual stimuli
Had me breaking out in tears;
So I wished to share this moment
But could only share with you a link
And received a couple of emoticons
To reveal what you felt and think.

There goes another little memory
That neither of us can share.
If I add mine up,
And add yours up,
Will it be enough to care?

You spoke to me at length on a subject
That you enjoy with such a passion,
But I zoned out a few sentences in
And responded with the most minimal interaction
Until I found a moment to break free
And sought out someone who'd share the stage;
We talked at length about cybersecurity
But I didn't realize you were disengaged.

There goes another little memory
That neither of us can share.
If I add mine up,
And add yours up,
Will it be enough to care?
