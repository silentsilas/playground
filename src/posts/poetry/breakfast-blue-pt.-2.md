title: Breakfast Blue Pt. 2

---
Oh, my good friend, I didn't mean to leave.  
It wasn't your fault, so no longer grieve!  
If I could, I would run back to your side.  
But, alas, a lack of legs slows my stride.

It's been over a year since I've last seen  
Your serious face and Chartwell's cuisine.  
Often I think this is for the better  
\'Til I shed tears as I read your letter.

Fake tears, that is, for I also lack eyes.  
In fact, let me unveil my disguise:  
I'm an object lacking animation,  
Given life through personification.

What words can I say to help you move on  
And accept the fact that I am now gone?  
Know that I too will miss your sweet lovin'  
For I'll always be your chocolate muffin.
