title: Silent Silas

---

The windows to my soul
Tend to have their blinds up,
And I leave the door locked tight
By keeping my own mouth shut

So my apologies if it's frustrating
That I'm so cold and calculating.

It's my modus operandi;
You can't spell "Silent" without Si.

But if it's any consolation,
I am striving to get better
At voicing my own thoughts
Without resorting to writing letters.
