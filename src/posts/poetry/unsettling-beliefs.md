Once you believe that someone can right your wrongs,
That leaves room for war and atomic bombs.

Once you believe that your rewards lie in heaven,
That leaves room for real-life to place second.

Once you believe that it all happens for a reason,
That leaves room to equate all change with treason.

Once you believe that you're free to leave the faith,
That leaves room for you to re-open the case.
