title: Leafblower

---
You're the girl sitting on the park bench.  
I'm the guy with a leaf blower.   
I've gotta do my job,   
So would you kindly please move over?

I'm walking right towards you,  
So don't say you didn't notice me.   
I'd like to get off work soon,   
So I'll give you until the count of three.

One  
Two   
...

Alright, so you've called my bluff.  
I'm not really going to do anything.   
I just wanted to look real tough,   
But this little bee ain't got no sting.

I'll just tell my boss that I missed a spot,  
And I'll explain my sad situation.   
Then we'll both laugh at the thought   
Of me writing poetry about my frustration.
