After we had passed around our time
Like a handout from a middle school teacher
Which left us as curiously disinterested
As the typical middle school kid-creature,

I had begun to realize we all had fun
While I analyzed the past
That I hold beneath my beanie.

With the help of Aladdin's nameless genie,
Tupac, and the also-immortal Houdini,
I relived the photos we claim
Frame us as fresh as a French Martini.

And if you don't believe me,
Well, I'd be quite surprised,

Considering the retina-rays,
Which flashed such a look
From behind your eyes

To broadcast the current thought
That's now crossing your mind
Which you'd otherwise only tell
To your roommate, pet, and/or the Lord divine.

You remember the fun we had, too.

Well, besides the homework, and exams,
And the whole "Hell freezing over"
Which couldn't stop our professor's plans

To take down our GPA's
And No-School snow days.

Comradery through common enemy.
Tomfoolery as tedium's remedy.
