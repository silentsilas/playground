title: Monday Morning Shift

These plants look beautiful, but not at this location.  
They must be eradicated according to administration.   
I brought out my tools; Some gloves and a spade,   
Then sat down, Indian style, to begin the raid.   
The roots, like little fingers, held on to dear life   
As I cut through their homes with an oddly-shaped knife.

To justify these cruel killings  
I thought of what they've done:   
Suffocated the superior plants   
And blocked out the lovely sun.

But what makes one plant superior and the other inferior?  
Just the fact that the other has a beautiful exterior?   
They are simply trying their best to make a living.   
We must see past our differences and be more forgiving.

But these thoughts lead down to a dangerous road;  
Let's not personify each seed we've sowed.

The sun now rises and heats the ground.  
The ice embedded within melts all around,   
And now a nice wet spot on my pants is found   
Which leaves me thinking of thoughts more profound:   
"I really hope no one's looking at me right now."
