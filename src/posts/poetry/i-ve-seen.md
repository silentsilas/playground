title: I've Seen
year: 2018

---
I've seen tears fall
From the face of a giant,
A hint of desperation
In the pleas of a king,

An attempt to forgive
The guilt-tripping violent,
Their genuine surprise
That neither learned a thing.

The wishes of a mother
Remain whispers in the wind,
And the riches of the world
In the words of humbled men.
