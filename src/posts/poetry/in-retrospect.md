Countless information's unaccounted for
The second the moment has passed.

The details you do retain are blurred
And the retention itself won't last.

The data chosen to be collected
Is picked by your values and beliefs.

Who's to know
If the changed past guarantees
The desired outcome's
Probability to increase?

(And what of
The endless repercussions it's released?)

In essence,
To put it bluntly,
Hindsight
Is not 20/20.
