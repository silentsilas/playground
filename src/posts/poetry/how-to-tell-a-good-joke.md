title: How To Tell A Good Joke
layout: poetry
---

If you promise not to tell, I have heard a good rumor:
Wisdom walks hand in hand with good humor.

If you're sworn to secrecy, then let it be known:
Let not a word spoken compel nature to groan.

If words of wisdom you believe you can afford,
Then lend me your ear: Your tongue is a sword.

If your lips are sealed, then read from this scroll:
What comes out of your mouth reveals your soul.
