title: Morning Commute

---

A few minutes into my morning commute
I had forgotten we can all read minds.
So my thought faucet ran up my brain bill
Spewing a membraneous mess inside.

I didn’t notice ‘til I parked the car
And smelled the fumes from under the hood.
I frantically thought of cats and cookies
To clean up the mess, but it did no good.

So I ditched the car and snuck into work,
Though I knew my hopes and dreams would be seen
Swirled amidst my self-doubt and worries
Like creamer mixed in bitter cups of caffeine.
