title: Who Am I?

---
Am I the clothes on my back  
And the hair on my head?  
Am I the people I'm with  
And the words I've said?

Am I the field I study  
And the school I attend?   
Am I the programs I write  
And the poems I've penned?

Am I the music I enjoy  
And the guitar I play?  
Am I the grade on my test  
And my ten page essay?

Am I the habits I've formed  
And the phrases I repeat?  
Am I the fake smile given  
To every person I meet?

Am I the religion I follow  
And the politician I elect?  
Am I every action I carry out  
And every thought I reflect?
