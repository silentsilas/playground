Told at a young age
That you're totally
Depraved,

Yet still a nominee
To receive
Eternity.

O, hallelujah,
You hypochondriac.

O, hippocampus,
Remember what you lack.

Told at a young age
You'll be called up
On stage.

If you don't like your task,
Just ask that this cup
Might pass.

O, Adonai,
Save the spotlight for me.

On you, we rely
To believe we're worthy.
