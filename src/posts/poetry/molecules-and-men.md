title: Of Molecules And Men
---

May we lose
All language
That we may see
As it is
And not
As we think,

For cells
Arose
From division
To divide
And conquer
Molecules
And men.

From the
Prokaryote
To the
Proletariat
A conflict
Ensues.

You're so sure
That you're full
Of yourself
As your cells
Dismantle
All that's
Consumed.

We break to build
Each building block
Into a likeness
Worth worshipping to.

To be at peace
Is to decompose.

To cease to be
Is to become
Every friend
And alleged foe.
