title: New Year's Retribution
layout: poetry
---

Our past predicts how prone we are
To repeat our mistakes in the present.
New Year resolutions are made
To prove ourselves convalescent.

Never again shall we regress
Back to our frail and Fallen state.
Instead, transform into super humans
Gaining skills and losing weight.

Only then will we be pleased
With who we see in the mirror.
On the contrary, oft' we find
What harms us, we hold dearer.

And so the cycle repeats itself
As our resolutions are broken.
Still, I vow to write more next year
Despite what has just been spoken!
