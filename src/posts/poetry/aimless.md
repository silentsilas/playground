In an act of self defense
I grew accustomed to solo living.

I held on to my two cents
Unsure of when it should be given.

I thought this to be the fatal flaw
That kept me from living right.

But now I see that aimlessness
Is what kills all men at night.

Living without a purpose,
Yet a desire to provide.

You know what youâ€™d like to do,
But what do you do with your time?
