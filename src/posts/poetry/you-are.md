You're the rest of a phrase
On the tip of my tongue.
You're the forgotten hook
To a song I'd once sung.

You're the key to a lock
Hanging just out of reach.
You're the part of the lesson
Our professors couldn't teach.

You're the tough decision
My mind could never make.
You're the perfect chord
I would find by mistake.

You're the trivial problems
And their pseudo-solution.
You're the broken promise
Of my New Year's Resolution.
