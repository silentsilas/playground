We live
Well enough alone,
So we left ourselves
Alone.

Our words
Might suggest otherwise,
But our actions
Are what's shown.

We share
Electromagnetic waves

But it might take
A million years

For massless particles
At the speed-of-light
To connect us to our peers.

We curse
Our WiFi connection
The moment
We lose reception,

But it takes some time,
And a few Doing Fine's
Before loneliness
Gets your attention.

We cognitively
Know this well,
Yet our bodies
Still cannot tell.

The modern man
In a tribeless land;
Evolution
Is confused as hell.
