you shoulda, woulda
â€” or could ya shuddup?
i didn't, but isn't
that tangent fucked up?
just listen & envision;
decisions are tough.
the rocks in my shoes
are to you only dust.

i did what i've done
and i did it with love;
if that doesn't do,
don't tell me what does;
for advice without end
advises you to give up.
but i've learned to let live
to let you keep this up.
