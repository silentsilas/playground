title: Unintentional Internalization
---

Our skin's as thick
As our words are sharp
To dampen the damage
We take to heart.

But sometimes they pierce
Right through our defenses,
Despite whether the offender
Had the best of intentions.

It's a wound that lingers
And leads to a scar
Once committed to memory
(Which shapes who you are).

For each one we've endured,
We've dealt so many more
For the most innocuous remark
Still can pierce like a sword.
