Silence speaks louder than words
At a decibel too loud to be heard
As an abrupt disruption of nothin'
For our conversation consumption.

Its presence is chilling
And instant buzz-killing
Yet still we act
As if it's not there.

Our tongues are untied
As the silence subsides
Yet still its message
Hangs heavy in the air.
