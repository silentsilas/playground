Alright, it's near the end of 2019. We've had plenty of time to figure out how to get rid of passwords. But we haven't. They're still here. So it's about time we admit that they're here to stay, and that we must better acquaint ourselves with them.

I'm here to make the case for _you_ to change a few of your digital habits. You will no longer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_fatigue" class="link-primary" target="_blank">release an exasperated sigh</a> when you see the dreaded "Sign Up" button for Yet Another Website. Your friends will no longer need to spend 15 minutes wrestling with your foggy memory to figure out your WiFi password, or perhaps your Netflix credentials, you dirty account-sharing lawbreakers. You will no longer need to hit the "Forgot Password" button for every site you only use once in a blue moon. Your hair will grow back and its color regain vibrancy. Your friends will respect you, and your enemies will fear you. Some of your friends will also fear you, but that's okay. They were always afraid.

Most importantly: You will no longer get hacked.

And no, I don't mean the kind where a friend posts a dumb status on your Facebook wall while you went to the bathroom. I mean the kind where you get a scary email that someone in Romania tried to access your Pinterest account at 2am EST. The kind where your computer starts to slow down and opens weird windows at random intervals. The kind where thousands of dollars were charged to your bank account, and you have to replace your credit card after proving the charges weren't made by you.
