Hey there! Welcome to <a href="/poetry/silent-silas/" class="link-primary">Silent Silas</a>. I write code during the day, and poetry at night. This is my playground.

This section in particular is where I'll discuss my terrible opinions on life, the universe, and the <a href="https://pastebin.com/raw/QUMSr4q5" target="_blank" class="link-primary">objectification of humanity</a>.

For the web developers out there, this was built with <a href="https://kit.svelte.dev/" target="_blank" class="link-primary">SvelteKit</a> via the <a href="https://threlte.xyz/" target="_blank" class="link-primary">Threlte Framework</a> so that my web experiments that rely on ThreeJS can be hosted here. It'll eventually use <a href="https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/sw-toolbox" target="_blank" class="link-primary">Service Workers</a> so that the entirety of the site is available offline.

As with most computer scientists, I stand on the <a href="/imgs/cs_abstraction.jpg" target="_blank" class="link-primary">shoulders of giants</a>.

The code is on <a href="https://git.silentsilas.com/silentsilas/playground" target="_blank" class="link-primary">Git</a> under the MIT license (while the poetry is under a restrictive Creative Commons license).
