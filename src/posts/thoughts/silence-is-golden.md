Hey there! Welcome to <a href="/writes/silent-silas/">Silent Silas</a>. I write code during the day, and poetry at night. This is my playground.

This section in particular is where I'll discuss my terrible opinions on life, the universe, and the <a href="https://pastebin.com/raw/QUMSr4q5">objectification of humanity</a>.

For the web developers out there, this was built with <a href="https://kit.svelte.dev/">SvelteKit</a> via the <a href="https://threlte.xyz/">Threlte Framework</a> so that my web experiments that rely on ThreeJS can be hosted here. It'll eventually use <a href="https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/sw-toolbox">Service Workers</a> so that the entirety of the site is available offline.

As with most computer scientists, I stand on the <a href="/imgs/cs_abstraction.jpg">shoulders of giants</a>.

The code is on <a href="https://github.com/Poeticode/silentsilas.com">Github</a> under the MIT license (while the poetry is under a restrictive Creative Commons license).
